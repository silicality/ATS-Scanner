# ATS-Scanner
This repository is a community-driven Resume Analyzer and ATS Scanner, built to help students and job seekers understand how resumes are parsed, analyzed, and evaluated by automated systems.

The project is designed as a real-world, problem-centric open-source project where contributors can work on meaningful features such as resume parsing, ATS scoring, job-description matching, and explainable feedback.

📌 Project Background & Credit

This project is forked from the original work by Omkar Pathak.

Original repository: https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pyresparser
